  <h1>Using the h1 header tag makes this header the most important of them all </h1>
    <p>This was written in a &lt;p&gt; or paragraph tag. This means that whatever is written within this tag will be displayed in a paragaph block. </p>
    <p>Here I used a separate &lt;p&gt; tag in order to demonstrate to which position and style (font, font-size, padding, margin etc.) this tag defaults.</p>
    <p>Side note: if you forgot how to encode html entities (so that the website shows symbold such as &lt; and does not think you are trying to open a new tag), go to <a href="https://www.web2generators.com/html-based-tools/online-html-entities-encoder-and-decoder" target="_blank">this page</a>. Here you can see the charset entity name to replace each special character with.</p>

  <h2>Here you can see a &lt;h2&gt; type header, the second most important of them all</h2>
    <p>As you can see above, while the number behind &lt;h&gt; increases (e.g. from &lt;h1&gt; to &lt;h2&gt;) its importance and therefore font size decreases.</p>
    <p>When using the paragraph tag, you can use in-line tags such as &lt;span&gt; tags to <span style="font-weight: bold;">highlight</span> words. In order to do that, type "style="the-style-you-want"" within the opening &lt;span&gt; tag.<br> Use the &lt;br&gt; tag to <br>
    start a new line within the paragraph. </p>

  <h2>Here you can see a snippet of code:</h2>
  <img src="snippet.jpg.png">

  <h2>Here is how that same code looks like on a website:</h2>
    <p>
      Want to search the web?
      Try <a href="https://google.com" id="the-best-link" class="banana"  target="_blank">Google</a>!
    </p>

  <h3>Let's anaylze what is happening in this code:</h3>
    <h4>The &lt;p&gt; tag, nesting:</h4>
    <p>Within this snippet we can see that the &lt;p&gt;/paragraph tag was used. The &lt;p&gt; tag requires an opening (&lt;p&gt;) and closing (&lt;/p&gt;) tag.
       That is because in between those two tags, one can insert values such as text, numbers, other elements and other tags.
       The value within the &lt;p&gt; tags is then displayed as a paragraph block just like the text you are reading now.
       This is also called "nesting". Nesting proposes the idea that each element of code (such as the &lt;p&gt; tag) are boxes that hold content. In this case the content is what is being written right now.
       At the same time, as part of the content of those boxes, one can place another box such as the &lt;a&gt; tag in our snippet above. Here we basically nested a box inside another box. We could say that the &lt;a&gt; tag is the child of the &lt;p&gt; tag.
       This child box can hold content istself, such as the link to the Google homepage above.</p>

    <h4>The &lt;a&gt; tag, attributes:</h4>
    <p>Inside the &lt;p&gt; tags of the snippet, you can see that textual values ("Want to search the web? Try"), and other elements/tags (&lt;a&gt; tag) were added. The &lt;a&gt;/hyperlink tag creates a link that leads to another webpage.
       In the opening &lt;a&gt; tag, one can add certain <span style="font-weight: bold;">attributes</span> which will change the value of the tag accordingly.
       The attributes added to the snippet &lt;a&gt; tag are: href="",id="", class="", and target="".
       The value of the href="" attribute is: https://google.com. In our &lt;a&gt; tag, the href="" attribute holds the URL to the webpage that you want your page to connect to - in our case the url to the Google home page. Wihout this attribute, your page will not be linked to another website. <br>
       The class attribute and id attribute are closely related. Both attributes specifically classify elements in our code - here the link.
       The value of the class="" attribute is: banana. The class attribute determines the class name (here: banana) of the element. Within a CSS style sheet, we can then target this element specifically and change its layout to our liking.
       One page can have multiple elements under the same class. One element can also have mutliple classes. We could therefore classify this paragraph under the class="banana" and under the class="cherry" and thus style it either the same way as the snippet class (banana) or as the "cherry" class. <br>
       The value of the id="" attribute is: the-best-link. The id attribute is more specific than the class attribute and thus overrides the class styling if an element has both a class and an id attribute. In our case, the styling of id="the-best-link" would override the styling of class="banana".
       One element can only have one id, and the same id can only be used on one element within a page. <br>
       The value of the target="" attribute is:_blank. This attribute determines the manner in which the link will be openend. Here, the value "_blank" determines that the link shall be openend in a new tab/window.</p>
